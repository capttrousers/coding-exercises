# coding-exercises

This repo is for the various coding exercises that I have completed. 

For now, the structure is individual java classes in src/ that each have main(). 
Eventually, features like robust testing and some sort of build system using Maven or Gradle will be implemented. 

First problem:
Input - two strings of alpha characters
Output - one string of the alpha characters of the intersection of the two input strings, ie the chars that both strings have in common. Order and duplicates are not important.

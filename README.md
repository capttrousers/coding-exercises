# coding-exercises

This repo is for the various coding exercises that I have completed. 

For now, the structure is individual java classes in src/ that each have main(). 
Eventually, features like robust testing and some sort of build system using Maven or Gradle will be implemented. 

First problem:
Input - two strings of alpha characters
Output - one string of the alpha characters of the intersection of the two input strings, ie the chars that both strings have in common. Order and duplicates are not important.

Second problem:
Create a mathmatical set of randomly generated integers
Input - size of set, maximum value
Output - set of random ints

Third problem:
Implement bubble sort, merge sort, heap sort, and quick sort

Forth problem:
Sudoku
